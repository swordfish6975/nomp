<h3>What is the PPLNT payout system?</h3>
<p>
PPLNT (pay per last n time)<br>
<i>Proportional payouts with a twist to protect you</i> <br>
A round is the time from when the pool found the last block until when the pool finds the next block. The length of a round is shorter, the higher the hashrate of the pool but there is also a luck factor involved in the length of round. Over a long period of time the average length of a round is predictable. Your shares are proportional based on the last 51% of the round. Shares that were earned before the last half the round are given less value. The older the share the less value they have. If you have mined the entire round or mined for the last 51% you will recieve a full proportional award. The reason we do this is because of pool hopping.</p><p>
If someone joins the pool at the beginning of a round and consistently leaves part way through a round to mine another pool, then under a proportional payout system they would receive an unfairly high payout at the expense of the miners who are loyal and mine the entire round. The PPNLT payout system rewards loyay miners and penalises pool hoppers. If you want a pool that you can you can mine with long term and not worry about pool hoppers stealing your rewards a PPLNT pool is your safest bet.

<h3>I've been mining for a bit. Why do I have no balance?</h3>
<p>
When mining, you don't earn coins until you've participated in a round that finds a block. Thus you will not see a balance until you have helped mine a round that solves a block.
If you just joined, even a few hours ago there is a good chance there has not been a block found yet that you were a part of when mining.
Stick around and the balance will come. Once a block is found your payout balance will not be updated until the block has approximately 100 confirmations. This is the same on all pools.

<h3>I've got a balance, Why have I not been paid?</h3>
<p>
Mining reward payments require 100 confirmations. It is not possible for us to do it any earlier or the blockchain would reject the payment.

<h3>My miner says X shares but the pool says Y, what gives?</h3>
<p>
Typically your mining software will show the total number of submitted shares you started your mining software. The pool will only show the valid shares for the current round as they are what will count towards the next found block. As such the two numbers are not comparable. They are using completely different accounting methods.

<h3>I had X shares and now they are much less or have gone, what gives?</h3>
<p>
We found a block, and your share count is now that of the new round. After the pool finds a block all share counts go back to zero. The shares that show on your miner page are only those for this round. The fact that your share count has reset is usally a sign that you're going to get paid soon.
